1.Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and 
  dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.
-> I choose N = 7 and  dt = 0.1 because good optimization range at 80mph.
   If N is chosen bigger than 7, for example N = 10, car drives unstable.
   Also, if N is chosen smaller than 7, for example N = 4, car drives unstable too.


The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. 
Student provides details on how they deal with latency.
-> Before MPC calculation, state values (cte, epsi, v)  are updated with guess value of latency.
   For example, velocity v is updated by following equation, v = v + throttle * guess_latency.
